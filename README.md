# API-Chat-Bot-Project

This program makes web request to receive data (REST) and utilizes
PIRCBOT to interface with a chat bot.
The chat server I used is FreeNode.
The program parses the JSON to use the data.

When the bot is connected to the chat, it reads commands entered by the user
which triggers a response, retrieving data from the API, and returning it from the bot
